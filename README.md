# passtrust

Ruby-based tool which allows you to have secure passwords that you can use anywhere, only by remembering simple passphrases.

PassTrust is able to convert any simple string into a secure password between 16 and 64 characters. This allows you to have easy-to-remember passphrases but strong & secure passwords.

**PassTrust is not a password manager, it's a generator.** It uses a variety of hashing algorithms to create your password, and the process is not reversible. (So nobody will know what your passphrase was unless it was really easy to begin with)

The generated passwords are very hard to brute-force, especially on the longer password settings.
